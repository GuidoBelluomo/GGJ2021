## Overview
This is a game project made in five days for GGJ2021. I didn't pay a lot of attention to the architecture and design patterns to save on upfront programming cost, but it didn't really help with long-term cost. In fact, most of it became spaghetti code by the end, increasing the cost and resulting in a particularly sleepless night by the second last day.

## Gameplay
You're Buzz, a zombie head with no limbs. Play two levels where you'll find limbs laying around which you can use to your advantage: the limbs have abilities, as well as an "ultimate ability" for traversing big obstacles. This results in losing the limb, but performing very significant actions towards the end goal: **finding a juicy brain.**

## Controls
Controls are explained at the beginning of the first level, but I feel like I need to explain the Swing/Grab action. When you found an arm, you can press Z to grab onto ceilings, which will make buzz Swing. Use the movement keys to gain momentum and Jump to sacrifice the limb and perform a big leap, or simply press Z again to let go (I may have accidentally given the character too much momentum when not sacrificing the limb, it probably works just as well as the jump)

## Rules
Legs allow you to jump. Pressing up (or W) and Spacebar will make you jump very high and leave the leg behind.
Arms allow you to grab onto ceilings as well as making you stop rolling.
Levers and switches can only be interacted with by throwing an arm at them. (Though actually I think legs work too, I haven't tested it but it occurred to me that they are probably equal for the levers. Either way you shouldn't be using legs, you need them.)
